# Basic programs

1. Fibonacci Series in Java
2. Prime Number Program in Java

# Arrays

1. Java Program to find the frequency of each element in the array
2. Java Program to left rotate the elements of an array
3. Java Program to print the duplicate elements of an array
4. Java Program to print the largest and smallest element in an array
5. Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which
has the largest sum.For example, given the array [−2,1,−3,4,−1,2,1,−5,4], the contiguous subarray [4,−1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
6. Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which
has the largest product. For example, given the array [2,3,-2,4], the contiguous subarray [2,3] has the largest product = 6.
